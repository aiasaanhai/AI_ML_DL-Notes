Python is a popular language for reinforcement learning (RL) research and development, and there are several libraries and frameworks available that cater to different aspects and complexities of RL. Here are some notable ones:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: 
    - An extensible toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.
    - Provides a wide variety of pre-defined environments, from classic control tasks to game simulations like Atari games.
    - Allows for custom environment creation.

2. **Stable Baselines** and **Stable Baselines3**:
    - A set of high-quality implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms based on OpenAI's baselines.
    - Stable Baselines3 is the PyTorch version, while the older Stable Baselines is based on TensorFlow.

3. **RLlib**:
    - Part of the Ray project, RLlib offers scalable RL training with support for various algorithms.
    - Can easily scale from a single machine to a large cluster.

4. **TensorFlow Agents**:
    - An RL library for TensorFlow, providing implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms.
    - Supports both TensorFlow 1.x (with TF-Agents 0.x) and TensorFlow 2.x (with TF-Agents 0.2.x and above).

5. **Spinning Up in Deep RL** by OpenAI:
    - An educational resource that provides simple implementations of fundamental algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, along with educational materials.
    - Aimed at newcomers to the field, it is both a library and a collection of educational documents.

6. **Tianshou**:
    - A PyTorch-based platform for deep reinforcement learning.
    - Offers implementations of various state-of-the-art algorithms.

7. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
    - PPO is a specific algorithm that has seen widespread adoption. While libraries like Stable Baselines and RLlib offer their implementations, there are standalone PPO implementations available on platforms like GitHub.

8. **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enterprises (Dopamine)**:
    - A research framework for fast prototyping of reinforcement learning algorithms by Google.
    - It emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, with a clear interface.

9. **Coach** by Intel AI Lab:
    - Provides implementations of various RL algorithms.
    - Allows easy benchmarking and experimentation.

10. **MushroomRL**:
    - A reinforcement learning library that offers a flexible interface for researchers while also providing high-level tools for fast algorithm prototyping.

These libraries cover a broad spectrum of needs, from educational and beginner-friendly resources to high-performance scalable solutions suitable for industrial applications. Depending on the specific requirements and the level of expertise, one can choose the most suitable library to start experimenting with reinforcement learning in Python.
